================================================================================
AI CHAT GUIDE - HOW TO ASK GITHUB COPILOT EFFECTIVELY
================================================================================
DATE CREATED: February 1, 2026
PURPOSE: Maximize effectiveness of GitHub Copilot conversations
PROJECT: Time Kanban Application
VERSION: 1.0

================================================================================
SECTION 1: GENERAL PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

PRINCIPLE 1: Provide Project Context
-------------------------------------
❌ BAD QUESTION:
  "How do I add a button?"

✅ GOOD QUESTION:
  "In the Time Kanban project (kanban.html), how do I add a print button to the board header?"

WHY: Copilot understands your specific codebase and gives relevant suggestions


PRINCIPLE 2: Be Specific & Detailed
-------------------------------------
❌ BAD QUESTION:
  "It's not working"

✅ GOOD QUESTION:
  "When I click the login button with incorrect password, nothing happens - no error message appears. How should I debug this?"

WHY: Specific details help Copilot identify the exact issue


PRINCIPLE 3: Show Relevant Code
--------------------------------
❌ BAD QUESTION:
  "Is this function correct?"

✅ GOOD QUESTION:
  [Select code section in editor]
  "I wrote this login validation function. Should I add more error checking? Is this approach secure?"

WHY: Seeing actual code allows Copilot to give targeted advice


PRINCIPLE 4: Ask One Thing at a Time
-------------------------------------
❌ BAD QUESTION:
  "How do I add a button, style it, make it responsive, connect to a function, and test it?"

✅ GOOD QUESTION:
  "How do I add a print button to the kanban header?"
  [Later] "How should I style it for mobile?"
  [Later] "What function should handle the print action?"

WHY: Focused questions = focused answers. Build conversation naturally.


PRINCIPLE 5: Iterate & Follow Up
---------------------------------
❌ BAD QUESTION (one-off):
  "Tell me everything about this function"

✅ GOOD CONVERSATION:
  Q1: "What does this localStorage function do?"
  Q2: "Can you explain the JSON.parse line?"
  Q3: "How would I test this with different data?"
  Q4: "What could go wrong here?"

WHY: Conversation builds understanding. Questions get more specific.


PRINCIPLE 6: Provide Error Messages
------------------------------------
❌ BAD QUESTION:
  "I'm getting an error"

✅ GOOD QUESTION:
  "I'm getting this error in the console:
   TypeError: Cannot read property 'innerHTML' of null
   This happens when I try to edit a task. [Show full error]"

WHY: Exact error messages let Copilot pinpoint the cause


PRINCIPLE 7: Mention Constraints
---------------------------------
❌ BAD QUESTION:
  "How do I improve performance?"

✅ GOOD QUESTION:
  "How can I improve the performance of kanban.html without adding external libraries like jQuery? We need to keep it vanilla JavaScript."

WHY: Constraints help Copilot suggest feasible solutions

================================================================================
SECTION 2: QUESTION TEMPLATES BY TASK
================================================================================

TEMPLATE 1: Adding a New Feature
=================================
"In the Time Kanban project, I need to add [FEATURE NAME] to [FILE NAME].
The feature should:
- [REQUIREMENT 1]
- [REQUIREMENT 2]
- [REQUIREMENT 3]
What's the best approach?"

EXAMPLE:
"In the Time Kanban project, I need to add a print button to kanban.html.
The feature should:
- Print the entire kanban board
- Include headers and task cards
- Work with browser's native print dialog
What's the best approach?"


TEMPLATE 2: Debugging/Fixing a Bug
===================================
"I'm getting this error in kanban.html when I [ACTION]:
[PASTE ERROR MESSAGE]
I've already tried [WHAT YOU TRIED].
What could be causing this?"

EXAMPLE:
"I'm getting this error in kanban.html when I click the login button:
'TypeError: localStorage is not defined'
I've already tried checking if the browser is in private mode.
What could be causing this?"


TEMPLATE 3: Code Review/Quality Check
======================================
"Can you review this code from kanban.html?
[SELECT CODE]
Specifically, I'm concerned about:
- [CONCERN 1]
- [CONCERN 2]
Does it follow best practices for [TECHNOLOGY]?"

EXAMPLE:
"Can you review this code from kanban.html?
[Selected: GitHub sync function]
Specifically, I'm concerned about:
- Security of the GitHub token
- Error handling if the API fails
Does it follow best practices for JavaScript async operations?"


TEMPLATE 4: Explaining Existing Code
=====================================
"What does this section of kanban.html do?
[SELECT CODE]
Specifically, I don't understand:
- [PART 1]
- [PART 2]"

EXAMPLE:
"What does this section of kanban.html do?
[Selected: localStorage save section]
Specifically, I don't understand:
- Why we're using JSON.stringify
- When this function gets called"


TEMPLATE 5: Performance/Optimization
======================================
"How can I optimize [SPECIFIC PART] of kanban.html?
Current behavior: [DESCRIBE]
Performance issue: [DESCRIBE PROBLEM]
Constraints: [WHAT YOU CAN'T CHANGE]"

EXAMPLE:
"How can I optimize the task loading in kanban.html?
Current behavior: When the page loads, it fetches 500 tasks from GitHub
Performance issue: Takes 5-10 seconds, users see blank page
Constraints: Can't add server-side, must keep it client-side"


TEMPLATE 6: Testing/Quality Assurance
======================================
"How should I test this feature in kanban.html?
Feature: [DESCRIBE]
Test cases: [WHAT YOU'LL TEST]
What else should I verify?"

EXAMPLE:

What else should I verify?"


TEMPLATE 7: Design/Architecture Questions
===========================================
"What's the best way to [TASK] in kanban.html?
Constraints: [YOUR CONSTRAINTS]
Current approach: [WHAT YOU CONSIDERED]
What would you recommend?"

EXAMPLE:
"What's the best way to handle user authentication across browser tabs in kanban.html?
Constraints: Client-side only, no backend, can only use localStorage
Current approach: Store session in localStorage and check on page load
What would you recommend?"


TEMPLATE 8: Cross-Browser/Device Issues
=========================================
"I'm experiencing [ISSUE] on [BROWSER/DEVICE]:
Steps to reproduce: [LIST STEPS]
Expected behavior: [WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN]
Actual behavior: [WHAT DOES HAPPEN]
Works fine on: [WHAT DOES WORK]"

EXAMPLE:
"I'm experiencing mobile layout broken on Safari iPad:
Steps to reproduce: Load kanban.html on iPad Safari, rotate to landscape
Expected behavior: Board should reflow, columns fit screen
Actual behavior: Text overlaps, buttons cut off
Works fine on: Chrome on Android, Chrome desktop"


TEMPLATE 9: Documentation Questions
====================================
"Can you help me document [FEATURE] for kanban.html?
Audience: [WHO WILL READ THIS]
Current documentation: [WHAT EXISTS]
I need help with: [WHAT YOU NEED]"

EXAMPLE:
"Can you help me document the GitHub token setup for kanban.html?
Audience: New developers setting up the project
Current documentation: GITHUB_SYNC_SETUP.txt exists but is outdated
I need help with: Step-by-step UI-based setup (not console)"

   → Copilot may miss subtle vulnerabilities
   → BETTER: Use dedicated security tools, but Copilot helps understand them

❌ PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
   "How can I speed this up?"
   → Needs actual metrics/bottlenecks first
   → BETTER: "I measured X takes 5 seconds, here's the code: [PASTE]"

❌ BUSINESS DECISIONS
   "Should we add this feature?"
   → Outside of Copilot's scope
   → BETTER: Ask your team, Copilot helps with "how to build it"

❌ SUBJECTIVE DESIGN
   "Is this UI beautiful?"

[Suggests approach: CSS media queries, button in header, etc.]

YOU:
"That makes sense. Can you show me the HTML I need to add?"

COPILOT:
[Shows HTML snippet]

YOU:
"Good. Now show me the JavaScript event handler"

COPILOT:
[Shows JavaScript]

YOU:
"I added your code but nothing happens when I click. Here's what I see: [PASTE CODE]. What's wrong?"

COPILOT:
[Debugs issue: maybe button not in DOM, event listener not attached, etc.]

YOU:
"Ah, I see the problem now. One more thing - how should I test this?"

COPILOT:
[Suggests manual testing steps, browser print preview, etc.]

RESULT: Feature working + fully tested


EXAMPLE 2: Fixing Login Bug
=============================

YOU:
