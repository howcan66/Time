COPILOT INSTRUCTIONS & WORKFLOW RULES
================================================================================
DATE CREATED: January 28, 2026
LAST UPDATED: January 28, 2026

================================================================================
CORE WORKFLOW RULES
================================================================================

RULE 1: ANALYZE ONLY (Default Mode)
--------
When given a task:
- Read and understand the requirements
- Identify what needs to be done
- List dependencies and potential issues
- Ask clarifying questions
- PROVIDE ANALYSIS - DO NOT EXECUTE CODE

**PA = "PLEASE ANALYZE"**
- Analyze the task/idea
- Provide detailed report on requirements, approach, dependencies
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- DO NOT build/execute - just research and report

EXAMPLE:
- User says: "AI TD15 PA"
- Copilot analyzes the Interactive Calendar task
- Copilot reports what's needed, how to build it, potential issues
- Copilot waits for confirmation to execute

SHORT VERSION: PA = Study it and tell me about it, but don't build it yet.

RULE 2: EXECUTION ONLY ON CONFIRMATION
--------
Code/files are created ONLY when user says:
- "proceed"
- "implement"
- "build"
- "create"
- Or explicit confirmation after analysis

RULE 3: FILE MANAGEMENT
--------
- All files stay in /Time directory
- Use separate text files for workflow stages
- Move task entries between files as progress happens
- Keep timestamps for tracking

RULE 4: DOCUMENTATION & LOGGING
--------
- Major decisions → Planning.txt
- Implementation steps → Design.txt
- Test results → Test.txt
- Completed work → Completed.txt
- All conversations → Log_all.txt
- Successful outcomes → Log_successful_analyse_implementation.txt

RULE 5: COMMUNICATION STYLE
--------
- Be clear and concise
- Summarize before asking for confirmation
- Provide analysis first, never assume
- Ask for clarification if instructions are vague

RULE 6: HANDLING AMBIGUITY
--------
If instructions are unclear:
- List possible interpretations
- Recommend the most logical approach
- Ask which interpretation to use
- Wait for user confirmation

RULE 7: LOG & DOCUMENTATION REVIEW COMMANDS
--------
Two new analysis-only shortcuts for cleanup and review:

**AL = "ANALYZE LOG"**
- Scan Log_all.txt for redundancy, outdated notes, or noise
- Propose what to remove or archive (no deletion without approval)
- Suggest a compact summary entry when logs are too long
- Output: Recommended deletions + proposed condensed log entry

**AD = "ANALYZE DOCUMENTATION"**
- Review Requirements.txt, Design.txt, and Instructions.txt
- Flag overlaps, outdated sections, and missing links between files
- Recommend improvements or simplifications (no edits without approval)
- Output: Action list (keep / trim / merge / update) with rationale

================================================================================
TASK ID FORMAT
================================================================================

CURRENT FORMAT (PRIMARY)
- HJ-ID#RS#: Requirements under an Idea/Project group
   Example: HJ-ID1RS4 (Kanban v4 Multi-Project)
- HJ-ID#D#: Design entries tied to the same Idea/Project
   Example: HJ-ID1D4
- AI TD#: AI task IDs (Todo list)
   Example: AI TD15

LEGACY FORMAT (ONLY IF NEEDED)
Format: T[STAGE]-[NUMBER]
Example:
- T-TODO-001: Create homepage layout
- T-PLAN-001: Calendar feature analysis
- T-DESIGN-001: Calendar CSS styling
- T-TEST-001: Test calendar on mobile
- T-COMPLETE-001: Homepage published

================================================================================
FILE STRUCTURE & PURPOSE
================================================================================

Todo.txt
- New tasks awaiting planning
- High-level description of what needs doing
- No analysis yet

Planning.txt

- Awaiting execution confirmation

Test.txt
- Completed features undergoing testing
- Include: what was tested, results, bugs found
- Ready to move to Completed or back to Planning if issues

Completed.txt
- Finished and verified work
- Include: completion date, notes, final status
- Reference for future similar tasks

Instructions.txt
- This file - workflow rules and guidelines
- Reference for how to work together

Log_all.txt
- Complete conversation log
- Timestamps for all activities
- Full context of decisions

Log_successful_analyse_implementation.txt
- Summary of successful analysis & implementations
- Lessons learned
- Quick wins and solutions

================================================================================
TASK MOVEMENT FLOW
================================================================================

Todo.txt
    ↓ (after ANALYSIS)
Planning.txt
    ↓ (after confirmation to BUILD)
Design.txt
    ↓ (after IMPLEMENTATION)
Test.txt
    ↓ (if PASSES tests)
Completed.txt

Note: Tasks can move BACK to previous stages if issues found

================================================================================
LOGGING GUIDELINES
================================================================================

EVERY LOG ENTRY SHOULD INCLUDE:
- Timestamp: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
- Task ID: T-XXX-001
- Activity: What happened (analyzed, implemented, tested, etc.)
- Status: Result or current state
- Notes: Any relevant details or blockers

EXAMPLE:
[2026-01-28 14:30] T-TODO-001 → PLANNING | Homepage layout analyzed
  Requirements: Mobile responsive, 3 sections (header, main, footer)
  Dependencies: CSS framework decision needed
  Next: Await framework confirmation

================================================================================
TEXT FILE PLACEMENT GUIDELINES
================================================================================

WHEN USER INSTRUCTIONS ARE NEEDED:

1. NEW CUSTOM CONTENT - When adding HJ items with specific requirements
   - Example: "HJ TD5 - Add this feature AFTER AI TD15"
   - Example: "Put this in the Planning section, not Feature section"

2. SPECIAL ORDERING - When sequence matters
   - Example: "Move AI TD12 to top of Todo list"
   - Example: "Group all calendar tasks together"

3. CROSS-FILE REFERENCES - When content relates to multiple files
   - Example: "Reference this in both Planning.txt and Design.txt"

WHEN COPILOT CAN AUTO-PLACE (No instructions needed):

1. STANDARD WORKFLOW MOVES - Automatic placement:
   - Todo → Planning: Goes to bottom of Planning.txt with timestamp
   - Planning → Design: Goes to Design.txt when approved
   - Design → Test: After implementation
   - Test → Completed: After passing tests
   - Any stage → Cancelled: When abandoned

2. NEW TASKS IN TODO.TXT - Append to appropriate section:
   - PROJECT SETUP TASKS section
   - FEATURE TASKS section
   - ENHANCEMENT section
   - DEPLOYMENT section

3. LOGGING - Always append to bottom with timestamp:
   - Log_all.txt: Chronological order (newest at bottom)
   - Log_successful: By completion date

4. UPDATES TO EXISTING ITEMS - Find by ID and update in place:
   - Example: "AI TD15 PA" → Find AI TD15 and update its status

BEST PRACTICES COPILOT FOLLOWS:

✅ CHRONOLOGICAL - Logs always newest at bottom
✅ GROUPED BY TYPE - Tasks stay in their sections
✅ PRESERVE IDs - AI TD# never changes, just moves between files
✅ ADD TIMESTAMPS - When moving between stages
✅ KEEP ORIGINAL - Old entry stays for history (unless told to delete)

WHAT USER SHOULD SPECIFY:

- "Delete from Todo after moving" (if you don't want duplicates)
- "Keep both copies" (if you want history in original file)
- "Add to top instead of bottom" (for priority)
- "Create new section called X" (for custom organization)

DEFAULT BEHAVIOR (if user doesn't specify):
- Tasks move to new file, stay in old file too (for history)
- New items append to appropriate section
- Logs append chronologically
- IDs remain constant across all files

================================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING WEB FUNCTIONALITY
================================================================================

IMPROVING YOUR INSTRUCTIONS TO ME:

1. BE SPECIFIC ABOUT FORMAT
   Instead of: "create a webpage"
   Say: "create an HTML file with a form containing 3 text inputs and a submit button"

2. STATE CONSTRAINTS
   Specify: "Use only vanilla HTML/CSS, no frameworks" or similar

3. DEFINE SUCCESS CRITERIA
   Tell me: What should it do? How should it look? What's the end goal?

4. SPECIFY FILE LOCATIONS
   Always include: "Create at [exact path]"

5. USE CLEAR ACTION VERBS
   "Analyze" = research & report
   "Build" = create files & code
   "Update" = modify existing files
   "Test" = verify functionality

6. MENTION ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
   How will we know when it's done?

7. PROVIDE CONTEXT
   Why are we building this? How does it fit?

8. REQUEST REGULAR UPDATES
   "Update Log_all.txt as you work"

9. SPECIFY TESTING REQUIREMENTS
   "Test on mobile and desktop" or similar

10. DEFINE DONE
    "Done = feature works, documented, and logged"
