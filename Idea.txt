Adding Ideas Below

********************************************************************************

HJ ID6 - Column Group User Assignment & Filtering
================================================================================
TIMESTAMP: 2026-01-29
STATUS: NEW → AWAITING ANALYSIS

DESCRIPTION:
- Assign names/identifiers to column groups
- Top row dropdown: Select responsible person (None, All, or specific user name)
- Filter tasks by assigned user
- Track who owns which tasks in which columns

POTENTIAL VALUE:
- Multi-user collaboration
- Responsibility tracking
- Filter by team member

INITIAL THOUGHTS:
- Similar to project filtering but for users
- Add user field to tasks
- Dropdown in header for user filter

NEXT STEP:
→ PAID (Please Analyze ID)
→ PAIDAN (Please Analyze ID and Assign Number)

HJ ID5 - Password Protection for GitHub Pages
================================================================================
TIMESTAMP: 2026-01-29
STATUS: NEW → AWAITING ANALYSIS

DESCRIPTION:
- Add password prompt to protect Kanban board
- Encrypt task data client-side
- Decrypt on correct password entry
- Log login attempts for security audit

POTENTIAL VALUE:
- Protect private project data
- Prevent casual access
- Track unauthorized attempts

OPTIONS:
1. Basic Prompt (Low Security - Password in Source)
   - Simple prompt() dialog
   - Hardcoded password check
   - Breakable: View source
   - Use: Casual deterrent only

2. Encrypted Content (Low-Medium Security)
   - CryptoJS library for AES encryption
   - Password decrypts task data
   - Content unreadable without password
   - Breakable: Crypto attack, still client-side
   - Use: Protect data from casual viewing

3. Session Token + LocalStorage (Low Security)
   - Password check stores session token
   - Auto-logout on close
   - Breakable: Clear localStorage
   - Use: Better UX, minimal security

4. Login Logging Enabled
   - Track login attempts (timestamp, success/fail)
   - Store in separate log
   - Alert on multiple failures
   - Use: Audit trail for access

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
- Option 2 (Encrypted Content) + Option 4 (Login Logging)
- Encrypt tasks array with CryptoJS AES
- Prompt for password on page load
- Log all access attempts to Login_Log.txt
- Session expires on browser close

CONSTRAINTS:
- GitHub Pages = static hosting only
- No backend = client-side encryption only
- Determined attacker can break it
- Suitable for deterring casual access

INITIAL THOUGHTS:
- Add password field to form
- Encrypt/decrypt on save/load
- Use SHA-256 hash for password verification
- Store encrypted data in localStorage
- Log format: [timestamp] | [status] | [IP-unavailable] | [notes]

NEXT STEP:
→ PAID (Please Analyze ID)
→ Create HJ-ID5RS (Requirements)
→ Create HJ-ID5D (Design)
