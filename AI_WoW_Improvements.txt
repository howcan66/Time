  No validation against existing users in validUsers array
  Admin must manually type email addresses (prone to typos)

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
  Replace email text input with dropdown list of existing users
  Allow selecting from validUsers array instead of typing

WHERE TO CHANGE:
  File: kanban.html
  Location: Invitations tab form (near line 1448, openInvitationForm())
  Element: #inviteEmail input field

BENEFITS:
  ✅ No typos in email addresses
  ✅ Faster user selection (click vs type)
  ✅ Consistent with existing users in system
  ✅ Better data quality in invitations
  ✅ Matches task assignment dropdown pattern

IMPLEMENTATION:
  - Change #inviteEmail from <input type="email"> to <select>

  - Add validation to check selected user exists
  - Time required: 15-20 minutes

PRIORITY: MEDIUM-HIGH
EFFORT: LOW (simple form change)
BENEFIT: HIGH (improves data accuracy, UX consistency)

STATUS: PROPOSED (ready for implementation)

================================================================================

IMPROVEMENT #16: Admin Logs - Add Column Headers & Grid Layout
==============================================================
CURRENT STATE:
  Login Logs tab displays plain text entries without structure
  No clear separation between timestamp, user, action, and details
  Users must parse log entries mentally (hard to read)
  Example: "[2026-01-29 10:15:23] | R18 | SUCCESS | Attempt #1"

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
  Add column headers with grid layout formatting
  Display logs in structured table format with 4 columns:
    🕐 Timestamp | 👤 User | 📋 Action | 📝 Details
  Use background color for header row (visual distinction)
  Align columns with consistent spacing
  Show real adminLogs array (not sample data)

WHERE TO CHANGE:
  File: kanban.html
  Location: renderLoginLogs() function (line 1390)
  Current: Creates simple <div class="log-entry"> for each log
  New: Creates grid layout with header row + data rows

BENEFITS:
  ✅ Much easier to scan and read logs
  ✅ Professional appearance (table-like layout)
  ✅ Clear distinction between columns
  ✅ Supports future sorting/filtering per column
  ✅ Shows real adminLogs array (not sample data)
  ✅ Visual hierarchy with color & styling

IMPLEMENTATION:
  - Add header div with 4 columns: [Timestamp | User | Action | Details]
  - Style header with background color (#f0f0f0) and bold text
  - Parse each log entry to extract 4 columns
  - Display in CSS grid with consistent widths
  - Add visual separators (borders) between rows
  - Time required: DONE (just implemented!)

PRIORITY: HIGH
EFFORT: LOW (formatting + CSS grid)
BENEFIT: HIGH (improves readability & professionalism)

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The Time project has a solid foundation but can be significantly improved with
relatively low effort. The recommended quick wins (1 hour total) will provide:

  ✅ More professional appearance
  ✅ Better team coordination
  ✅ Faster onboarding for new contributors
  ✅ Cleaner repository
  ✅ More effective AI collaboration

The larger improvements (migration, GitHub Actions) should follow after
establishing the foundation improvements.

All recommendations are cumulative - implement them at your pace.
