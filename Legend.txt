LEGEND - INDEXING & WORKFLOW SHORTCUTS
================================================================================
DATE CREATED: January 28, 2026
VERSION: 1.0

This file explains the indexing system and shortcuts used throughout the
Time project documentation.

================================================================================
INDEXING SYSTEM
================================================================================

AI TD# = Artificial Intelligence Todo items (created by Copilot/AI)
         Used for reference, analysis, and tracking

HJ TD# = Human (You) Todo items (created by user)
         When you add new tasks or items

Example:
  AI TD1 - Use <p> for paragraphs, <h1>-<h6> for headings
  AI TD2 - Use <div> to group related content
  HJ TD27 - Create user profile feature

NUMBERING CONVENTION:
- Continuous numbering across entire project
- Starts at AI TD1 in Todo.txt
- Increments through all files
- Range allocations:
  • AI TD1-50:   Todo.txt (web components + project tasks)
  • AI TD51-100: Planning.txt (analysis & planning)
  • AI TD101-150: Design.txt (design specifications)
  • AI TD151-200: Test.txt (testing & QA)
  • AI TD201-250: Completed.txt (finished work)
  • AI TD251-300: Instructions.txt (workflow rules)
  • AI TD301-350: Log_all.txt (activity log)
  • AI TD351-400: Log_successful_analyse_implementation.txt (successes)

When you add items, use:
  • HJ TD1, HJ TD2, HJ TD3, etc. (sequential on user additions)
  • Can appear in any file

================================================================================
WORKFLOW SHORTCUTS
================================================================================

PA = "Please Analyze"
     Instruction: Analyze this task and provide detailed report
     Output location: Move to Planning.txt with analysis

EX = "Execute" / "Implement"
     Instruction: Build/create this feature
     Output location: Move to Design.txt → Implement → Move to Test.txt

CONFIRM = "Yes, proceed with this approach"
          Clears any pending questions or blockers

BLOCK = "This cannot proceed due to blocker"
        Marks task as blocked, awaiting resolution

REVISE = "Make changes to this approach"
         Instruction to go back and revise previous work

RETEST = "Test again after changes"
         Move back to Test.txt after revisions

CLOSE = "Mark as complete and move to Completed.txt"
        Task is finished and verified

================================================================================
COMBINED USAGE EXAMPLES
================================================================================

USER INSTRUCTION: "AI TD15 PA"
  → Means: Analyze task AI TD15 (Project Directory Structure)
  → Expected: Detailed analysis moved to Planning.txt

USER INSTRUCTION: "HJ TD1 Create a contact form PA"
  → Means: New user task - create contact form - please analyze
  → Expected: AI analyzes and reports to Planning.txt

USER INSTRUCTION: "EX AI TD12"
  → Means: Execute/implement task AI TD12 (Base HTML Template)
  → Expected: Files created, moved to Design.txt → Test.txt

USER INSTRUCTION: "AI TD5 REVISE - simplify the requirements"
  → Means: Revise task AI TD5 based on feedback
  → Expected: Updated analysis and approach

USER INSTRUCTION: "EX PA"
  → Means: Execute after analyzing
  → Expected: Full analysis + immediate implementation if confirmed

USER INSTRUCTION: "AI TD18 RETEST - test on mobile only"
  → Means: Re-run tests for AI TD18 with specific focus
  → Expected: New test results for mobile version

HOW TO USE THIS SYSTEM
================================================================================

STEP 1: Find the Item
  - Look for "AI TD#" or "HJ TD#" prefix
  - Reference the ID range table to know which file to check

STEP 2: Give Instructions
  - Add shortcut after item: "PA", "EX", "CONFIRM", etc.
  - Can combine: "EX PA" or "AI TD15 PA"

STEP 3: Tracking Progress
  - Items move between files as they progress
  - IDs stay constant throughout lifecycle
  - Check Planning.txt to see analyzed items
  - Check Design.txt to see ready-to-build items
  - Check Completed.txt to see finished work

STEP 4: Logging
  - Each major action logged in Log_all.txt
  - Successful completions logged in Log_successful_analyse_implementation.txt
  - Use AI TD# in log entries for traceability

================================================================================
STATUS INDICATORS (Optional Enhancement)
================================================================================

Current Status Tags (used in files):
  ✓ COMPLETE - Task finished
  → IN PROGRESS - Currently being worked on
  ✗ BLOCKED - Cannot proceed
  ⚠ PARTIAL - Partially done
  ○ NOT STARTED - Awaiting action
  ◐ PLANNING - In analysis phase
  ◑ DESIGNED - Design complete, ready to build

Can be combined with shortcuts:
  "AI TD5 ✓ COMPLETE CLOSE"  → Mark as complete and close
  "AI TD7 ✗ BLOCKED - Awaiting design decision"

================================================================================
COMMUNICATION TIPS
================================================================================

CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS:
  ✓ Good: "AI TD15 PA - focus on technology choices"
  ✓ Good: "HJ TD1 Create dashboard PA"
  ✗ Unclear: "Do the thing"

EFFICIENT TRACKING:
  ✓ Use AI TD# to reference items precisely
  ✓ Use PA/EX to clarify intent
  ✓ Include brief context if needed

WHEN TO USE WHICH:
  - PA: When you want analysis before building
  - EX: When you're ready for implementation
  - EX PA: When unsure but want analysis then building
  - CONFIRM: After analysis shows you agree with approach
  - BLOCK: If something prevents progress

================================================================================
QUICK START COMMANDS
================================================================================

"AI TD1 PA"
  → Analyze web component: Text Display

"EX AI TD11"
  → Build task: Create GitHub Repository

"HJ TD1 Set up team roles PA"
  → User adds new task: Set up team roles (analyze it)

"AI TD15 REVISE - make it simpler"
  → Revise the planned approach for task 15

"AI TD18 RETEST - check mobile compatibility"
  → Re-test task 18 focusing on mobile

"AI TD25 CONFIRM CLOSE"
  → Confirm approach is good and close the task

================================================================================
VERSION HISTORY
================================================================================

NOTES & FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

- IDs are permanent references (never reused)
- User can add HJ items at any time
- Keep this file handy for reference
- If new shortcuts needed, add to this Legend
- Numbering ranges can expand as project grows
- Consider adding checksum or auto-increment in future
